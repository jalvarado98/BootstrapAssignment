In this assignment, I get to touch on my previous assignments but with the help of bootstrap.
With Bootstrap by my side I was able to add things easier than before.
I started by creating three blank html files
I then saw things that were wrong from the previous assignment and fixed them.
I remember what I found difficult from the first assignment, and looked up a solution on bootsrap and added it to my assignment.
I'm not sure how to make my links work, so I hope they work this time.
I learned how to make a site accessible with mobile devices and cannot wait for the next one.
